## Response:

### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging part of this assignment was debugging to find which styling piece was conflicting with the common CSS shared by all pages, causing a specific page not to behave as I intended. There were conflicting style choices between the common CSS and page-specific CSS. Once I became familiar with the rules and patterns, I found it relatively easy to work with HTML and CSS. 

I spent approximately 18 hours on this assignment.


### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile-friendly?

I moved the navigation bar from the left side of the page to the bottom to take up less space over the content. I removed any left margin to make the layout more compact for smaller screens. I added padding to the bottom of the content to ensure it does not interfere with the navigation bar.


### What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?

I made sure to use the same background color across all pages for consistency. I carefully chose the fonts for each page, ensuring the font on the scores page matched the theme of the game. I’m particularly proud of adding icons for different social platforms in the credits section on the rules page.


### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?

A description of the types of ships that can be placed on the board, each varying in length. An interactive game board where users can click on a grid box to change its format. A timer that starts counting instead of just displaying the timestamp.


### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

I spent approximately 18 hours on this assignment.
